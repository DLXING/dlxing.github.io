#### Research interests

* Our research mainly focuses on the **diversity** and **dynamic** of ecosystems (mainly forests) at **multiple scales**, with a special emphasis on understanding various macroecological patterns, including beta diversity and many others. 

* We use both **empirical** and **theoretical** approaches to address our research questions. 

    + The empirical data we collect and analyze are mainly from forest inventories. 

    + Our current theoretical exploration relies heavily on probability theory.

    + We use `R`, `C++`, and `Python` to analyze data and implement our theoretical models.
